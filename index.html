								"Ivan and I worked closely together over the past 15 years during which time he has been one of the most consistently best performers in the various roles he has held that i can remember. From the time we first met his attention to detail, his commitment to the task at hand and his high standards of delivery have made him a valuable addition to the team and its leadership. He`s a quiet spoken gentlemen but is never shy about delivering an honest and fact-based opinion when required. Ivan's depth of knowledge and experience combined with his strong work ethic and willingness to support and help others to deliver positive results makes him someone who I would recommend for any role requiring his skills"

Ivan has a good eye and mind for pulling many (seemingly) standalone facts and figures into line and then coming to a conclusion, which is always beneficial to the organization. He has a good ability to analyze and summarize tendencies and coming forth with workable recommendations. It’s been only a pleasure working with Ivan”

He is able to think outside the box to analyze and navigate easily through multiple systems to provide the Group a comprehensive snapshot of business trends. Ivan heads a team over 10 staff in 4 countries providing leadership and mentoring to his colleagues. Ivan also was a key member of the implementation of our current operation system across the group, which required many hours of data review and implementation on the ground on roll out. Ivan is also a level minded and direct acting individual that provides the organization with genuine feedback and reporting which is critical to our strategy.”

					<h3>“ALONE WE CAN DO SO LITTLE, TOGETHER WE CAN DO SO MUCH.” - Helen Keller</h3>
							<h3>Personally:</h3>

								Passionate, optimistic, fun loving, simple, persistent, enthusiastic, achiever, forever learner, meticulous, dependable, family man, and approachable are certainly the characteristics my friends and colleagues will agree. Well, I am more than that, much more and seasoned! 

								<br />I believe in practicing mindfulness. When I am not playing with the data or making decisions or supporting the management at work, I am improving my cooking skills, watching Netflix or YouTube for interesting stuff, following geeks and their inventions online. I can be good company for social activities, or motivational chat which takes us back on memory lanes, the experience talks! 
								<br /><br />
							<h3>Professionally:</h3>

								Logically minded, creative visualizer of practical solutions. love to dig into detail, data, and trends to evaluate improvement opportunities (includes digging into discrepancies and problems to ensure those are addressed before they accumulate and cause loss to the business). A firm believer of getting basics right on almost everything, while also believing few exceptions are part and parcel of every business. A natural troubleshooter with great understanding on the process in both the industries I’ve worked to date. To accomplish this, I focus on using the available technology with detailed observations of people, processes and transactions. Creating, scaling, and optimizing the existing process to minimize the discrepancies to deliver the best results possible are the positives delivered over the period, which has made me grow within the organization, especially the present one where I am assisting the top management with broader view of the risks to be managed and, constantly assisting with development strategies. The journey which got me here is because of few of the following aspects:

									<ul><li>	My thought process is always centered and balanced around customer service and my organization’s profitability.
										</li><li>	I love excelling in execution of big ideas, projects within the given support and constraints. 
										</li><li>	I trust my instinct strongly; however, I back that instinct with data for the decisions I support or make.
										</li><li>	I love to win (all of us do, don’t we?). I would gladly accept and learn when the other party is right. On rare occasions, I do give up when there are other priorities to be dealt with.
										</li><li>	I relate and narrate well to make others understand and get involved with interest.
										</li><li>	I constantly learn because I always want to move ahead.
										</li><li>	I stay calm and focus on quality decisions.
									</li></ul>
							<h3>My vision:</h3> 
									To be part of an establishment, where I can make a difference with all that I have accumulated over the years. My belief is that, I can; it’s just the right opportunity. I strive to keep learning to succeed; to teach, share and motivate others to follow suit. To enjoy everything I do, to be appreciated and remembered for the contributions I make in every business I was and am part of. To achieve more with meaningful and productive efforts. To grow, to lead and ensure growth of others along the way. To gather knowledge and spread the same. To make my career journey fruitful and worthy of travel, to me, to others and to the organization that I am working for.
